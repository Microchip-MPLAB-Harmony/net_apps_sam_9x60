    "content": "For the TCP/IP demonstrations, both the target board and the host computer should be in the same network. The host computer can be connected to a router via an ethernet cable or Wi-Fi. The target board should be connected to the router via an ethernet cable. Please refer to the following connection diagram. | All the TCP/IP Application Demonstration projects that are part of this distribution use the Microchip hardware development boards. They are pre-configured with specific PHY Drivers. The default PHY driver can be changed as some of the hardware boards support different PHY daughter boards. To use a different PHY for a specific board, use MPLAB® Harmony Configurator (MHC) to select and configure the PHY. Make sure that correct PHY address and configuration flags are used for the particular PHY daughter board. The MII/RMII and I/O configuration flags should match the hardware for the PHY board. The TCP/IP application demonstrations assume that IPv4 is enabled. If IPv4 is not enabled in MHC, the code in app.c will not build and needs to be updated to remove the IPv4 dependencies. | All the demos have DHCP enabled, and expect a DHCP server to be available. If there is no DHCP server, then the default static IP address will be used: 192.168.100.11. If this static address does not match your network settings, use MPLAB® Harmony Configurator (MHC) to modify the static IP address of the network interface. | The NetBIOS name of the TCP/IP application is specified during the initialization of TCP/IP stack. It is the hostName member of TCPIP_HOSTS_CONFIGURATION structure. The NetBIOS service must be enabled in demonstration configuration, for the TCP/IP demonstration to respond to NetBIOS queries. Alternatively, use the IPv4 or IPv6 address (if IPv6 is enabled) of the board directly. | The IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be obtained by running the TCP/IP Discovery utility on the computer. It requires the TCP/IP Announce module enabled in demonstration configuration, through MHC. | . ",

    "content": ". | Build the demo by opening the project in the IAR Embedded Workbench . | Copy the project output, harmony.bin, to the SD card that is used to load the executable and run it on the SAM9X60-EK board. Note: the boot loader on the SD card, boot.bin, should be configured to load the harmony.bin image, not a uboot.bin image. | Configure the Development Board as given Configure Hardware. | Make the demonstration setup as shown Network Setup. | Build and download the demonstration project on the target board. | If the board has a UART connection: . | A virtual COM port will be detected on the computer, when the USB cable is connected to USB-UART connector. | Open a standard terminal application on the computer (like Hyper-terminal or Tera Term) and configure the virtual COM port. | Set the serial baud rate to 115200 baud in the terminal application. | Insert the SD card into J5 on the SAM 9X60 board and press the reset button which is labeled ‘SW3’ on the silkscreen. At this moment the board should boot and display messages on the terminal console. | See that the initialization prints on the serial port terminal. | When the DHCP client is enabled in the demonstration, wait for the DHCP server to assign an IP address for the development board. This will be printed on the serial port terminal. | Alternatively: Use the Announce service or ping to get the IP address of the board. | Run tcpip_discoverer.jar to discover the IPv4 and IPv6 address for the board. | . | . | Execution : . setudppacketoptions, getudppacketoptions and sendudppacket are the UDP client APP commands. | Set the UDP packet options by typing setudppacketoptions at the terminal console. | Verify the UDP packet settings by typing getudppacketoptions at the terminal console. | Send the UDP packet to the destination using the sendudppacket command. | After the sendudppacket command is input, the demonstration will make a DNS query to look up the host name and send a UDP packet to that host. | The output message will be received by the UDP server on the port that is configured by the command setudppacketoptions. | For UDP Client test, the UDP Server application is required to run on the computer (SocketTest, Packet Sender etc). This demonstration is tested with SocketTest v3.0(http://sockettest.sourceforge.net/) . | Open the SocketTest software and select UDP server for the configured port number as per the command setudppacketoptions. | . | . | .
